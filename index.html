                  Always check Driving Instructor's Valid Licence before taking in-car lessons. It has come to our attention that lots of driving schools have unqualified and fake driving instructors who don't have valid instructor licences, so please be careful before taking any lesson or commitment. Check their licences for your safety. Don't be fooled by cheap prices and packages.
